        <p>My name is Renan, a seasoned Software Engineer and a Master's Researcher, with over a decade of professional experience in the corporate sector. In 2018, I embarked on a journey to Melbourne, Australia, with the dual purpose of advancing my academic pursuits and gaining international experience. Prior to this venture, I contributed my skills and knowledge to esteemed institutions such as the <a href="http://www.fab.mil.br/">Brazilian Air Force Command</a> (FAB), <a href="https://www.impacta.edu.br/">Impacta Technology College</a> (Impacta), <a href="https://unisantanna.br/">Sant'Ana University Center</a> (UniSantana) and the <a href="http://www.ufpa.br">Federal University of Para</a> (UFPA).</p> 
          
          
        <p>During the 2020 pandemic, I started providing remote services in PHP, Javascript, Wordpress, MySQL and AWS Services as a Web Developer for a company located in the city of Traralgon in the state of Victoria called <a href="https://www.imagedirect.com.au/">Image Direct</a> in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYTRTUzh59s/">team of 6 Developers</a>.
          
          In 2021, I received a <a href="https://renanrcrr.github.io/awards/">Sponsorship Visa</a> as a Software Engineer affiliated with Image Direct while working as a full-stack with JS (Node.js, React.js and Next.js), PHP, CSS, HTML, Liquid, Graphql, Restful API, AWS Services, Shopify (Templates and Apps) and Wordpress focused on the e-commerce industry.
          
          In March 2024, I relocated to a new city in South Australia: Adelaide, with the intention of obtaining my permanent residence in that regional area and explore new opportunities. In that context, I served as a Software Engineer for the renowned company <a href="https://www.solarreviews.com/">Solar Reviews</a> in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAPbP5rSOZd/">team of 9 engineers</a> in a short-time contract with Laravel, GCP services, PHP, Typescript, Vue.js and Tailwind focused on the solar energy industry helping the company during a migration from a legacy funcionalities to a new system in Laravel version 10.</p>
          
        
        <p>My professional portfolio encompasses a diverse range of projects, allowing me to proficiently engage in discussions across various technological domains. 
          
          I am interested in Cloud, AI, Big Data and Data Science and whenever I can I try to study, investigate, research and invest in these great areas that attract me. 
          
          I possess a strong command of object-oriented paradigms and am equally adept at working collaboratively in a team or autonomously, with or without supervision. 
          
          I look forward to discussing how my extensive experience and skills can contribute to your endeavors.</p>
          

        <p>I obtained my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAYmBjNyVxF/">Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</a> in 2008 from the <a href="http://www.cesupa.br">University Center of Para</a> (CESUPA). Subsequently, in 2009, I pursued a Postgraduate degree in Systems Analysis at the renowned UFPA. 
          
          Later, in 2012, I completed my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAVWEzhSV_j/">Master's degree in Computer Science</a> - from the same university - implementing a framework in JEE (JSF 2.0) integrated with a <a href="https://github.com/renanrcrr/gaadt-cm">Genetic Algorithm</a> for non-abstract data types and two tools both developed in JSE, one for editing Conceptual Maps called CMTool and another for editing Domain Ontology called Ontool. 
          
          The framework called WebCMTool was intended to make available on the web the process of evaluating students in the classroom in the Computer Science Department of the UFPA through the use of concepts based on domain ontologies.
            
          In 2020, I finished a Diploma of Business program with a specialized focus on Digital Marketing at <a href="https://ait.edu.au/">Academy of Interactive Technology</a> (AIT) in Melbourne.</p>
            
            
        <p>Between 2012 and 2018, I held the position of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjyKjDFnmmF/">Second/First Lieutenant Systems Analyst</a> at FAB. I served as the Head of the Development and Support Department of the Information Technology Advisory for 4 years in military organizations such as the Subdirectorate of Supply and the <a hrefi="https://www2.fab.mil.br/gapsp/">São Paulo Support Group</a>. 
          
          Additionally, I assumed the role of Head of the IT Department for 2 years at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHVov0FSmG/">São Paulo Air Force Administration</a>. 

          During this period, my team worked on a robust ERP system for the Brazilian government in collaboration with (<a href="https://ciandt.com/">CI&T</a>), utilizing a core stack based on JEE (Apache Tapestry, JSF, and Spring Framework) and PostgreSQL with JPA using Hibernate as the object-relational mapping layer. 
          
          In addition, a shared database was integrated via ETL to a stacker crane system, utilizing RFID technology, primarily focused on logistics, supply chain, IoT, food subsistence, and military uniform sales across the country.

          These systems also included technologies such as Servlets, EJB, JMX, Selenium, JUnit, XML, JasperReports, Pentaho Suite, and JBoss, among others. The architecture was a centralized client-server model, with data replication and update distribution across more than 50 remote cities.

          I developed Python optimization scripts that improved the performance of RFID tag cache queue readings. I also contributed to system version upgrades for the management and housing control of military personnel developed in PHP, Typescript, Vue.js, and MySQL. 
          
          Another significant contribution was the development of an online bulletin control software called SIBOL, built with JSP and Servlets, capable of querying and extracting personal information of military personnel, directly applied to the human resources department, streamlining the consultation process in three military organizations.</p>
            
            
        <p>For 5 years, I contributed assertively to Brazilian education as a Master Professor at two universities in São Paulo, <a href="https://renanrcrr.github.io/teaching/">Impacta and UniSantana</a>.
            
          My educational and professional journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science and technology, and I am eager to leverage this experience to contribute to meaningful projects and initiatives.</p>
