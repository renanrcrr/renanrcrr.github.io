        <p>I am Renan, a seasoned Software Engineer and accomplished Master Researcher, boasting over a decade of professional experience within the corporate realm. In 2018, I embarked on a journey to Melbourne, Australia, with the dual purpose of advancing my academic pursuits and cultivating international expertise. Prior to this endeavor, I contributed my skills and knowledge to esteemed institutions such as the Air Force Command, Impacta Technology College, Sant'Ana University Center, and the Federal University of Par√°. In the year 2021, I was granted a Sponsorship Visa as a Software Engineer in Melbourne, affiliated with the esteemed company <a href="https://www.imagedirect.com.au/">Image Direct</a>. My professional portfolio encompasses a diverse array of projects, enabling me to proficiently engage in discussions spanning various technological domains, including cloud computing and programming languages. I possess a strong command of object-oriented paradigms and am equally adept at working collaboratively within a team or autonomously, with or without supervision. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my extensive experience and skills can contribute to your endeavors.</p>

        <p>I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in the year 2008 from Para University Center (<a href="http://www.cesupa.br">CESUPA</a>). Following this, in 2009, I pursued a Postgraduate degree in System Analysis at the esteemed Federal University of Para (<a href="http://www.ufpa.br"></a>UFPA). Subsequently, in 2012, I achieved my Master's degree in Computer Science from the same institution.

          In 2020, I embarked on a Business Diploma program with a specialized focus on Digital Marketing at <a href="http://www.theleftbank.edu.au">The Left Bank</a>. This program is slated to conclude in 2021.
          
          Between 2012 and 2018, I held the position of First Lieutenant System Analyst at the Brazilian Command Air Force (<a href="http://www.fab.mil.br/">FAB</a>) in Brazil. Concurrently, I served as a Master Professor at the esteemed Impacta Technology College (IMPACTA), accessible through this link: (<a href="https://www.impacta.edu.br/">IMPACTA</a>). Moreover, I actively participated as a speaker at various technology conferences and groups throughout Brazil.
          
          My educational and professional journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science and technology, and I am eager to leverage this background to contribute to meaningful projects and initiatives.</p>
