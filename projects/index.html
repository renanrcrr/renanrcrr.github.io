Images are sent to a backend engine in Laravel, which processes the images and uploads them to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The images are identified by their hash, and their storage URL are returned in the payload of a fifth system. Those URLs are then saved in the database using Eloquent for future reference.</p>

In this project, I developed an automated process to identify clients who were assigned in the last 72-96 hours and have not received a text message in the last 14 days. This is done using Eloquent through a Laravel job that runs once a day. Additionally, slightly different messages are created depending on the site the clients used, and these messages are sent at the appropriate times based on their time zones.</p>

It is noteworthy that in the Melbourne Archdiocese this Chaplaincy is composed on the one hand, by all countries whose official language is Portuguese, such as Portugal, Brazil, East Timor, Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde and Macao. While on the other hand, there are three ethnic groups constantly attending to the Chaplaincy: Portugal, East Timor and Brazil, which have their consistency in boiling tradition of the Portuguese, the Asian spirit of the East Timorese and the sporty charisma of Brazilians. All this without forgetting the new generations, those who were born in Australia and accompanying during important events or parties.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">When working with RFID technology it is important to note that there is an RFID antenna responsible for capturing the transmit signal from the RFID tag chips and transmitting them to a reader that will process the signal. In this project, MOTOROLAS readers were used to process the labels and send the data to a middleware that was used as a mediator to transport the data to programs of different protocols using JavaEE. However, it was observed that excessive processing slowed down especially when the readings estimated at around 10 million tags read. Given this situation, an application was developed as a layer between middleware and enterprise software to optimize these readings.</p>

However, despite reporting the total number of boxes available, it does not specify what type of boxes are available for storage, nor whether all boxes are already occupied in the warehouse. In this context, an application using JavaFX was developed to solve this problem, allowing reports to be generated in order to inform the operator about the management, if there is a possibility of inclusion of a new product in the system and how many hives and standard free boxes are available.</p>
